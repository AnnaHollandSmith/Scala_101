# Module 1: Introduction

**1: Introduction to Scala:**

 - _Scala has modularity:_ don't have one global name space for all classes. Languages that don't have this become difficult to maintain over time as they get larger.

 - _Statically typed:_
  - Proven correctness prior to deployment
  - Performance

- _Lightweight, composable syntax:_
   - Low boilerplate ( don't have to write much code to do very simple things)
   - Syntax is very familiar to other data-centric Languages

- _Stable yet innovative:_

**Scala's History:**

- 1990's: Made Java better via generics in the "javac" compiler.
- 2001: Decided to create an even better Java.
- 2003: First experimental release.
- 2005: Scala 2.0 written.
- 2011: Corporate stewardship.
